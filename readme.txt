To install this, put the dll's in the main mushclient program directory and the
plugin xml file in your plugins directory,
usually worlds\plugins.
Once done, load the plugin globally or in each world.
After that, it should work with JAWS, Window-eyes, NVDA and
system access without having to do anything.

If you want to recompile this dll, you'll need PureBasic, the lua libs and includes. The
forum post for the includes is at:

The libs can be found at http://luabinaries.sf.net.

PureDispHelper is also required, start at: http://forums.purebasic.com/english/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=26744
