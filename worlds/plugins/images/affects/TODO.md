Add SpellDown triggers, so the removal of spells can be more accurate in regard to time.
Nayru's Love:

I fixed the existing gifs (removed the green from them)

Add in INDEFINITELY as an option for time... i.e.

echomagic        indefinitely, level 92.
combomagic       indefinitely, level 83.
power surge      indefinitely, level 83.
