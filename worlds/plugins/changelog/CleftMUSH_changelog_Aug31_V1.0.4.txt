Changelog 8/30/19 V1.0.4

The Zelbess notifications no longer send to GROUP, but to a fake channel called [Tracker].
You can use this channel to send misc info to yourself without spamming other people.
The Zelbess notifications can be toggled on or off by typing "ferryinfo".

Volume can now be controlled by typing volume NUMBER (volume 0 = mute, volume 100 = max)

Max_EXP now shows the appropriate max_exp based on your remorts.

Cackling now makes you sound like Kefka.

Fixed the many broken rooms in Honey I shrunk the kids, where it was breaking the mapper.
It won't draw those rooms, currently, sorry.
